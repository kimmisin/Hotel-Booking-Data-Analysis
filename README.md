# Hotel-Booking-Data-Analysis

Data contains booking information for two hotels from 2018-2020. The goal of this project is to create a database with the data then cleaning/formatting the data to be analyzed and visualized in Power BI.

Questions:
	1) Is the hotel revenue growing each year?
	2) Should the parking lot be expanded? 
	3) What trends can we see in the data?

Process:
	1) Build a MySQL database
	2) Develop SQL queries
	3) Connect Power BI to the database
	4) Visualize findings
	5) Summarize findings
